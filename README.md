# SpaceMission
Space Mission is a single player game for iOS

## Gameplay ##
You can choose between 3 different game modes:
### Classic ###
    In this Gamemode you have to hit as many Enemy-Spaceships 
    as you can. The game ends if you were hit by an Enemy-Spaceship
    or if you miss 3 Enemies.
### Time Mode ###
    In this Gamemode you have a time limit of 10 seconds. But if you
    hit an enemy you get 2 seconds on top. 
    THIS GAMEMODE IS NOT FINISHED...
### Single Shot ###
    As you might expect in this gamemode you have only 1 shot. If you
    hit an enemy you get another bullet.
